- Documentation omitted to state that number of boards can now also be range:
	so for example 11-20 will make 10 boards numbered 11 to 20
	not tested with all output formats at the moment
- In types.h the unsigned long was replaced with uint32_t from <stdint.h>
	Needed because of 64 bit implementations
